# Channel

One of ["link", "collect", "qrcode"]. In an older version we used to support different channels like 'gpay', 'phonepe' etc. However, we now support only the following channels - link, collect and qrcode. To process payments using gpay, you will have to provide channel as 'link' and provider as 'gpay'
